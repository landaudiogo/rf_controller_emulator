Garage Clicker:
433.9MHz
Probably uses rolling codes between clicks.
Starts out with a preamble, then goes on to repeating the code 4 times.
Preamble is 10 '1's in a row.
Within a single click, repeats the code other 4 times.


first pulse width = 0.001130

short: 0.055870 - 0.056255 = total of 0.000385s
	Duty-Cycle: ~0.25

long:  0.053595 - 0.054730 = total of 0.001135s
	Duty-Cycle: ~0.75



Q: May the duty cycles be related to the binary encoding of the message?
large pulse period: 0.152685 - 0.154205 = period of 0.001520s
short pulse period: 0.164055 - 0.165570 = period of 0.001515s
